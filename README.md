 MATH260 Final Project

The program ‘heatequation.py’ uses the Crank-Nicolson method to solve the heat diffusion problem 
in a rod where the two ends of the rod are insulated and subject to given boundary conditions.

The report for this project is "Final Project Report.pdf."
To produce the plots in the report, simply run the Python file heatequation.py.
